This site was built with Gatsby.

I finally decided to take the plunge into modern web development after hearing good things about Gatsby.
I've also wanted to build a portfolio website and deploy it onto Github Pages.
Since Gatsby produces static sites, it'd be a perfect choice!

Throughout this process, I've learned a few interesting things.

# What Gatsby *really* is

At surface level, Gatsby is a *static-site generator*.
But it actually something more interesting: it generates static sites by using:
1. Server-side rendering (SSR) at **build time**
2. Route-based code splitting
3. High performance browser APIs

(You could call it a JAM stack)
 
Those three techniques help produce great performing sites.

This [post](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-04-02-behind-the-scenes-what-makes-gatsby-great/) explains exactly why and how, but here's my abridged version.

# What's SSR anyway?

## Client vs Server side rendering

## Build time SSR?!

# Routing

## Webpack and JS bundles

# Modern browser API
