Correctness

It may be worth reading [about soundness](type-soundness) too

## Providing type correctness

With that out of the way, here are some tools to use to make sure our code is typed well

### Type widening & narrowing

Analgous to type-casting in languages like `C++`, the precision of types can vary

In TypeScript, we just need to be aware of when we inadvertantly widen/narrow a type

```ts
const welcomeString = 'Hello there' // 'Hello there'
let replyString = 'Sup' // string
replyString = 'Hey'
```

Even when we use `let`, TypeScript widens that variable's typing because it needs to be reassignable

These other scenarios of widening/narrowing
- Some [code flows](../intro#code-flow) work by continuously narrowing the type
- Unions narrow types (`type status = 'online' | 'offline'`)
  - Unless (`type status = 'online' | 'offline' | string`)
- TypeScript's **strict mode** will ignore `undefined` and `null` in unions
  - Basically forcing all types to be narrowed

### `any` and `unknown`

`any` tells TS to **allows ambiguity**
- It is your escape hatch back to JS-land

```ts
const obj = JSON.parse('{}')
obj.x.y.z // could crash

declare function debug(value: any)
```

`unknown` tells TS to **enforce specifics**
- TS will bug code that uses these types until they assert a type

```ts
const jsonParser = (jsonString: string): any => JSON.parse(jsonString)
jsonParser(`{ "name": "Dorothea" }`).name // OK, but dangerous! We can't always be sure `name` exists...

const jsonParserUnknown = (jsonString: string): unknown => JSON.parse(jsonString)
jsonParser(`{ "name": "Dorothea" }`).name // error! (thankfully)

type User = { name: string }
const account = jsonParser(`{ "name": "Dorothea" }`) as User // assert
account.name // OK and safe ðŸ‘Œ
```

### `never`

`never` tells TS to help indicate unreachable (dead) code paths
